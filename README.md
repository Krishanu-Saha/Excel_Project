**Introduction:**
The Excel project aims to analyze a dataset containing various demographic and behavioral factors related to bike purchases. The dataset includes information such as ID, marital status, gender, income, region, age, whether a bike was purchased or not, number of children, education level, occupation, home ownership, number of cars, and commute distance. The project involves transforming and summarizing the data using pivot tables, charts, and a dashboard to gain insights into the relationships between different variables.

**Objective:**
The objective of this project is to explore the relationships between demographic factors, such as gender, age, and commute distance, and the likelihood of purchasing a bike. By analyzing the data and visualizing the findings, the project aims to provide valuable insights into the target audience for bike purchases, potential marketing strategies, and trends that can assist in decision-making processes.

**Data Summary:**
The dataset consists of several variables, including ID, marital status, gender, income, region, age, bike purchase status, number of children, education level, occupation, home ownership, number of cars, and commute distance. To improve data clarity, certain values were replaced, such as 'M' and 'S' in marital status being replaced with 'Married' and 'Single,' respectively, and 'M' and 'F' in gender being replaced with 'Male' and 'Female,' respectively. Additionally, a new column named 'Age Bracket' was created to categorize individuals into three groups: 'Adolescent' for ages below 32, 'Middle Age' for ages below 54, and 'Old' for ages above 54.

**Approach:**
The project involved several steps to analyze the dataset effectively. Initially, a separate worksheet was created by copying the original dataset to perform transformations and calculations. Replacements were made to certain values in the 'Marital Status' and 'Gender' columns to improve readability.

Next, three pivot tables were created to examine the relationships between different variables and the likelihood of bike purchases. The first pivot table compared 'Gender' with 'Purchased Bike' and calculated the average income for males and females who purchased bikes, as well as non-purchasers. The second pivot table explored the relationship between 'Commute Distance' and 'Purchased Bike' and counted the number of bike purchasers for different commute distance ranges. The third pivot table analyzed the correlation between 'Age Brackets' and 'Purchased Bike,' counting the number of bikes purchased within each age group.

To provide a visual representation of the findings, charts were inserted based on the pivot tables. These charts were then combined into a dashboard, presenting the conclusions derived from the data analysis.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the analysis conducted, the following conclusions were drawn:

1. Gender: The average income for males who purchased a bike was approximately 58,000, while for females, it was around 50,000. Non-purchasers, regardless of gender, had an average income of approximately 500,000.

2. Commute Distance: Bike purchasers tended to have commute distances ranging from 2 to 5 miles.

3. Age Brackets: The middle age bracket (ages below 54) accounted for the highest number of bike purchases.

These insights can help inform marketing strategies and target specific demographics for bike sales. By understanding the purchasing patterns based on gender, commute distance, and age, businesses can tailor their marketing efforts to reach the most receptive audience and increase the likelihood of successful bike sales.
